# JaymiesGame
Clone of Google chrome's dinosaur game that's available when disconnected from the internet. The game consists of your character a turquoise block moving constantly to the right side of the screen. Red enemy blocks are generated at random intervals. Speed at which the your block moves increases over time and subsequently so does the frequency at which the player has to dodge and avoid red blocks. If a red block is touched the game ends. 
Written in lua without the cute dino art.
